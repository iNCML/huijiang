Unlike programming languages, they allow metaphor, ellipsis, ambiguity, deixis, and context-dependent meaning. Yet humans typically recover the intended meaning with high accuracy.</p> <p>Recent theoretical work <d-cite key="Jiang2023LatentSpaceEmergent"></d-cite> introduces <strong>ε-ambiguity languages</strong> as a formal tool to model this phenomenon. In this framework, although many meanings are technically compatible with a linguistic expression, one meaning dominates the posterior probability, and ambiguity occurs only with small probability ε(x). In <d-cite key="Jiang2023LatentSpaceEmergent"></d-cite>, it argues that:</p> <ol> <li>Natural languages empirically exhibit ε-ambiguity.</li> <li>ε-ambiguity is theoretically necessary for expressivity, efficiency, and robustness.</li> <li>ε-ambiguity provides a coherent explanation for both human semantics and LLM emergent abilities.</li> </ol> <h3 id="model-definition">Model Definition</h3> <p>As in <d-cite key="Jiang2023LatentSpaceEmergent"></d-cite>, we assume:</p> <ul> <li>A latent intention space $\Theta$.</li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>A surface linguistic expression <em>x</em> generated via a distribution $q(x</td> <td>\theta)$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>A listener infers meaning via the posterior probability $Pr(\theta</td> <td>x)$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </li> </ul> <p>A language is an <strong>ε-ambiguity language</strong> if for every meaningful expression x:</p> \[\Pr(\theta_0 \mid x) \ge 1 - \varepsilon(x),\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>$\theta_0$ is the intended meaning,</li> <li>$\varepsilon(x)$ quantifies residual ambiguity.</li> </ul> <p>This describes a <em>sparse posterior</em> over meanings: a dominant intention and a long but very small tail of alternatives.</p> <h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3> <p>This model predicts that:</p> <ol> <li>Communication is reliable but not deterministic.</li> <li>Ambiguity decreases <strong>multiplicatively</strong> when multiple cues or messages are provided.</li> <li>Latent-intention inference is feasible even without explicit symbolic structure.</li> </ol> <p>The fundamental principle behind ε-ambiguity languages is that linguistic expressions exhibit <em>partial but not perfect</em> semantic determinacy. Messages tend to convey one meaning with high probability, but never with absolute certainty. Real-world natural languages possess exactly these properties: they support efficient communication despite intrinsic ambiguity, and ambiguity is controlled by contextual, semantic, and pragmatic mechanisms.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>The ε-ambiguity framework formalizes this intuition within a probabilistic generative model of communication, where meanings (latent intentions $\theta$ ) are drawn from a space $\Theta$, and surface messages are generated by noisy processes with intention-specific distributions $q(x</td> <td>\theta)$. The framework provides a mathematical explanation for why LLMs can infer hidden meanings from text and why phenomena such as chain-of-thought reasoning reduce uncertainty.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The central question of this article is:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>What empirical and theoretical evidence supports the view that natural languages satisfy the definition of ε-ambiguity languages?</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>We demonstrate that evidence comes from multiple research domains.</p> <hr> <h2 id="evidence-from-linguistics"><strong>Evidence from Linguistics</strong></h2> <h3 id="lexical-ambiguity-and-polysemy">Lexical Ambiguity and Polysemy</h3> <p>Natural languages contain extensive lexical ambiguity <d-cite key="Lyons1977Semantics"></d-cite> <d-cite key="Cruse1986LexicalSemantics"></d-cite>.
