I am a professor in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/) at the [Lassonde School of Engineering](https://lassonde.yorku.ca), [York University](https://www.yorku.ca) in Toronto, Canada. My research focuses on a wide range of topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with particular emphasis on deep learning theory and methods, as well as their applications in speech and language processing and computer vision. I have an extensive publication record in these areas. A selection of my recent works can be found [here](publications/), while my complete list of publications is available on my [Google Scholar profile](http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=lQi05ZkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I maintain a [technology blog](https://incml.github.io) where I share insights, updates, and developments in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and related technologies.
